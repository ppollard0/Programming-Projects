# UNO Game Programming Assignment Assignment
## Programming Assignment 4

### Overview
The purpose of programming assignment 4 is to create a simulation of the card game UNO that allows the efficacy of various card selection strategies to be studied. To this end your job is to supply a Player class that implements the strategy of your choice for selecting an UNO card to play. The code for a Player object must follow the rules of UNO as published in the official rules of the game. ( [Official Rules](http://unotips.org/pdf/official_rules.pdf) ).  *Read the official rules. They are different than those used by most people, and the simulation follows official the rules!*

Resources you will need are included in this GitHub repo and online.  The files are:

+  UNOGameAssignment.pdf - The details of the assignment, including the design of the simulation application. You will find a copy in the /doc folder of the GitHub repo. ***Start by reading through this document***.

+  CSLibrary.jar - This library archive contains the CSLibrary code. The jar file is included in the GitHub repository. You will need this library in order for the Deck and Hand classes in the cards package to work. ***Very Important: Link your project code to the CSLibrary that is provided!***

+  TestPlan.pdf - This document describes the tests provided in the test folder of the project. It is also located in the /doc folder of this repository. ***Read this document after you have read the assignment document***.

+  official_rules.pdf -  The official rules of UNO. This document serves as the definitive requirements for the game and player. A copy is in the /doc folder of this repository. 

+  The API documentation for the CSLibrary classes can be found online: [CSLibrary API](http://mcs.drury.edu/ssigman/CSLibrary/). 

+  The API documentation for the UNO project packages and classes can be found at: [UNO API](http://mcs.drury.edu/UNO/).

+  Starter code for the project is in this repo.

### Your Assignment ...

Your job in this assignment is to write a player class that implements some strategy for playing an UNO card when it is your turn to play. ***The strategy must be supported by a suitable choice of a data structure.***  Requirements can be found in the documentation listed above.  See the assignment document, *UNOGameAssignment.pdf*, for a test-driven approach for developing your player.
