# Graph

The graph.py package provides classes, GraphAM and GraphAL, for representing graphs as an adjacency matrix or an adjacency list.  The code in this repositiory utilizes type hints.  It also illustrates some advanced features of Python programming such as named parameters, default values for parameters, and use of the numpy Python library.  The code is the basis for an programming assignment.
