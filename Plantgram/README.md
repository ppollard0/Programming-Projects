# PlantGram
## Semester Project for Application Development I
### Fall 2021

### Project Description
PlantGram is an application that allows a community of users to collaboratively identifying plants.  A user of the application may post a photo of a plant and a short description to the plant to a common board read by all users.  Users may then post messages debating the identity of the plant.  This process is known as identifying a plant.  Users may certify the identification of a plant by voting for an identification.  When the 75% of the users vote for a plant identification, the plant is entered into the club’s catalog of successfully identified plants.  This catalog is known as “the Plant Catalog” and can be browsed by all club members.

Clubs are created by one user who is known as the Club Facilitator.  The Club Facilitator creates the club by uploading club information, including a club logo and any rules that govern the behavior of club members.  In addition, they are responsible for inviting members to join the club and for moderating the posts of users.
