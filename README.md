# Overview
These are snippets of code that I had throughout my college career, along with personal projects that I've started working on.

# School
These are snippets of code from my years at Drury, which give a view into how I progressed as time went on.

## 1st Year
A set of Python and Greenfoot games that I made as we transitioned from basic code to more object-oriented programming 
## 2nd Year
Heavier on the Java side with a few projects and a social media-style web application with a non-SQL database.
## 3rd Year
Projects from a few different classes and a marketplace application that I worked on as a part of a hackathon, which won best in show. The class projects are located within the folder, but the hackathon repo can be found [here](https://github.com/Jhutchinson98/Digi-Farm-Marketplace).
## 4th Year
This year doesn't hold any code because I was working on my senior project, where we continued to work on a website and application for the school newspaper to use once it's complete. It wouldn't be responsible to post the source code for an application that the university may use.
## 5th Year
This holds some of the code that I used in basic AI training and testing. I also completed 2 internships, but I did not keep any of the code that I created, and I would not publish any information that I am not authorized to publish due to security concerns.
# Personal
These are personal projects that I've finally found the time to do. I spent most of my time in school committing myself to school, work, or wrestling. Now that I have none of these around anymore. I figure it's a great time to start working on getting better at what I love.

## Web App
This is a simple web application and SQL Server that I've begun working on. There will be different pages displaying different features I'm testing out. As the project continues, the documentation on this project will, in turn, expand.
